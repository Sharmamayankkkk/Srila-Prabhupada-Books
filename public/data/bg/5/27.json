    "translation": "The yogi whose mind is peaceful, who is dedicated to the self, finds happiness within the soul. Such a yogi experiences the ultimate bliss, untouched by material distractions.",
    "purport": "This verse describes the state of a yogi who has achieved deep inner peace. A yogi who has mastered control over his mind and senses is not swayed by material desires or distractions. His happiness comes from within, from the realization of the self. This is the essence of true spiritual fulfillment. The verse emphasizes that external things cannot provide lasting happiness; only a calm and peaceful mind can experience true bliss. By focusing on the self and achieving mental tranquility, a yogi attains spiritual peace that transcends all material concerns. The ultimate joy comes from union with the divine and from being aligned with one's higher purpose."

    "translation": "Of all creations I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna. Of all sciences I am the spiritual science of the Self, and among logicians I am the conclusive truth.",
    "purport": "Among created manifestations, the total material elements are first created by Mahā-Viṣṇu and are annihilated by Lord Śiva. Brahmā is the secondary creator. All these created elements are different incarnations of the material qualities of the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the beginning, the middle and the end of all creation.\n Regarding the spiritual science of the Self, there are many literatures, such as the four Vedas, the Vedānta-sūtra and the Purāṇas, the ŚrīmadBhāgavatam and the Gītā. These are all representatives of Kṛṣṇa. Among logicians there are different stages of argument. The presentation of evidence is called japa. The attempt to defeat one another is called vitaṇḍa, and the final conclusion is called vāda. The conclusive truth, the end of all reasoning processes, is Kṛṣṇa."

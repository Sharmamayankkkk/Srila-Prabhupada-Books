    "translation": "Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritualmatters which You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion isnow dispelled.",
    "purport": "This  chapter  reveals  Kṛṣṇa  as  the  cause  of  all  causes.  He  is  even  thecause  of  the  Mahā-Viṣṇu,  and  from  Him  the  material  universes  emanate.Kṛṣṇa is  not  an incarnation; He is the  source  of  all incarnations. That  hasbeen completely explained in the last chapter. Now,  as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of Kṛṣṇa as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is  glad  that  he  has  a  great  friend  like  Kṛṣṇa,  but  now  he  is  thinking that although he may accept Kṛṣṇa as the source of everything, others may not. So  in order  to  establish Kṛṣṇa's divinity for all, he is requesting Kṛṣṇa in this chapter to  show  His  universal  form. Actually when  one  sees the  universalform  of  Kṛṣṇa  one  becomes  frightened,  like  Arjuna,  but  Kṛṣṇa  is  so  kindthat  after  showing  it  He  converts  Himself  again  into  His  original  form. Arjuna  agrees to what Kṛṣṇa   says  several times. Kṛṣṇa is  speaking to  himjust  for  his  benefit,  and Arjuna  acknowledges that  all this is  happening tohim  by  Kṛṣṇa's  grace.  He is  now  convinced that Kṛṣṇa is the  cause  of  allcauses and is present in everyone's heart as the Supersoul."

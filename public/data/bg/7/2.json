    "translation": "But those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; others who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; but My devotees, worship Me, Arjuna, and they dwell in Me.",
    "purport": "In this verse, Lord Krishna explains that different types of devotees worship different forms of the divine as per their understanding and desires. Those who worship demigods attain the results corresponding to those demigods, and those who worship ancestors similarly reach their destination. However, the devotees who worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna Himself, attain the supreme destination, uniting with Him eternally. This distinction highlights the uniqueness of devotion directed towards Krishna and the ultimate goal of spiritual realization."

    "purport": "In this verse, the Supreme Lord Krishna identifies Himself as the Supreme Soul, the ultimate reality that resides within all living beings. This indicates that every individual soul is a part of the Supreme Soul, and thus, the connection between the individual and the Supreme is established. The term 'guḍākeśa' refers to Arjuna, who has conquered sleep, symbolizing a person who is alert and aware. This awareness is crucial for understanding the nature of the Supreme and one's own self. The Lord states that He is the beginning, middle, and end of all beings, emphasizing His omnipresence and the fact that everything emanates from Him, exists within Him, and ultimately returns to Him. This concept is fundamental in understanding the nature of the universe and the role of the Supreme in it. The purport of this verse is to highlight the importance of recognizing the Supreme Lord as the ultimate source of all existence. By understanding this, one can cultivate a deeper relationship with the Supreme and realize their own spiritual identity."

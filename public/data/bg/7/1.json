    "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.",
    "purport": "In this verse, Lord Krishna explains the importance of understanding His divine nature. The knowledge of His appearance and activities is essential for liberation from the cycle of birth and death. The term 'divyam' indicates that His birth and activities are not like those of ordinary beings. They are transcendental and beyond the material realm. One who understands this truth is liberated from the material existence and does not take birth again. Instead, he returns to the spiritual world, where he can associate with the Supreme Lord. This understanding is crucial for anyone who seeks to progress on the path of spiritual realization. It emphasizes the need for knowledge and wisdom in devotional service."

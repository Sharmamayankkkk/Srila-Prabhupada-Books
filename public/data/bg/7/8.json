    "purport": "In this verse, Lord Krishna reveals various aspects of His divine presence in the world. He identifies Himself with the taste of water, the light of the sun and moon, and the sacred syllable Om, emphasizing His omnipresence. By associating Himself with these fundamental elements, Krishna illustrates how He is the essence of all that exists. This understanding helps devotees recognize the divine in everyday experiences. The mention of Om signifies the ultimate sound that represents the Supreme Reality, further establishing Krishna's connection to the Vedas and spiritual knowledge. This verse encourages individuals to see the divine in all aspects of life, fostering a deeper appreciation for the presence of Krishna in the world around them."

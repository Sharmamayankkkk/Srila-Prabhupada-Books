    "translation": "If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of all mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self.",
    "purport": "It is said that one cannot see the form of the Lord with material eyes. To be able to see the universal form of the Lord, one must have divine vision. Arjuna requests the Lord, as the master of all mystic power (Yogeśvara), to grant him that vision. This verse expresses both humility and eagerness from Arjuna to understand Kṛṣṇa’s supreme form beyond the material manifestation."

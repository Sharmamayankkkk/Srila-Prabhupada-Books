    "translation": "Arjuna saw in that universal form countless mouths and eyes, many wonderful visions, with many divine ornaments and upraised divine weapons. He was garlanded gloriously, clothed in divine garments, anointed with divine fragrances. All was wondrous, resplendent, unlimited, and with faces in all directions.",
    "purport": "In these two verses, the magnificence of the universal form is described. Arjuna is given divine vision to witness this supreme form, which is impossible to perceive with ordinary eyes. The Lord appears with innumerable faces, eyes, and hands, adorned with celestial ornaments and weapons, exhibiting splendor far beyond material conception. This divine form is not limited by time or space. The presence of faces and eyes in all directions symbolizes omnipresence and omniscience. The Lord's beauty and glory are further emphasized by divine garlands, garments, and fragrances, showing that He is the source of all auspiciousness and opulence."

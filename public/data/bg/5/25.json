    "translation": "Those who have surrendered to the Yoga of action, with a steadfast mind, in total surrender, attain the supreme happiness in life.",
    "purport": "This verse speaks about the power of Karma-Yoga, the Yoga of action, and its ability to lead to the ultimate realization of the self. Through Karma-Yoga, a person surrenders his mind and intellect to the higher divine purpose, letting go of selfish attachments and actions, thus gaining access to the supreme happiness of life. True happiness lies in focusing on actions that serve the greater good, where all actions are dedicated to the divine, and the results are seen as offerings rather than possessions. The ability to offer one's actions in such a way purifies the mind, making it capable of union with the higher spiritual essence. As one becomes free from egoistic desires and learns to live a selfless life, the path to spiritual fulfillment is achieved."

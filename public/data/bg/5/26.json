    "translation": "A person who initiates actions through his body, speech, and mind, whether right or wrong, should not engage in actions that are against the rightful course or contrary to human nature.",
    "purport": "This verse emphasizes the importance of righteous actions in every aspect of life. A person must act in accordance with their higher nature, performing actions with a pure mind and right understanding. If one engages in actions driven by desires or ego, they risk straying from the righteous path. This verse encourages one to always check whether their actions align with the moral principles of the universe. Actions are not to be performed for selfish gain, but rather with the spirit of selflessness and devotion. The body, speech, and mind must all work harmoniously in service to the greater good and the Divine, ensuring that one’s actions are always in line with dharma."

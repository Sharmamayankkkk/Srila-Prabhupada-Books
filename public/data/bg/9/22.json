    "translation": "But those who always worship Me with exclusive devotion, meditating on My transcendental form—to them I carry what they lack, and I preserve what they have.",
    "purport": "One who cannot live for a moment without Kṛṣṇa consciousness always thinks of the Lord and engages in devotional service in various ways—hearing, chanting, remembering, praying, worshiping, serving, cultivating friendship, and surrendering everything. Such devotion, full of spiritual potency, gradually perfects the devotee in self-realization. His only goal becomes the eternal association of the Supreme Lord. This dedication is the essence of true yoga. Yoga here refers to the means of attaining union with the Supreme, and kṣema refers to the protection and preservation of spiritual progress. The Lord personally ensures that the devotee does not fall down, by supplying what he needs and safeguarding what he possesses in spiritual life."

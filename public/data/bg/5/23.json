  "translation": "He who controls the senses and is free from the attachment to sense objects, who is not affected by sleep or desires, and who walks the peaceful path, renouncing all material desires, attains the supreme peace.",
  "purport": "This verse speaks about the nature of a true yogi who has mastered his senses and has completely detached himself from the material world. The path to supreme peace involves not being influenced by the distractions of the body, mind, or senses. A true yogi renounces worldly pleasures and desires, transcending sleep and attachment, and follows a path of inner peace and self-discipline. This path is peaceful because it is free from the turmoil created by uncontrolled desires and attachments. The state of peace referred to in this verse is a direct result of controlling one's mind and senses, and it is the key to spiritual progress. Such a yogi remains unaffected by the material influences of the world and lives in harmony with the divine will."

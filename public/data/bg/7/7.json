    "translation": "O Dhananjaya, there is no truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.",
    "purport": "In this verse, Lord Krishna emphasizes His supreme position as the ultimate truth. He declares that there is nothing greater than Himself, reinforcing His status as the Supreme Being. The analogy of pearls strung on a thread illustrates how all of creation is interconnected and dependent on Krishna. Just as pearls derive their value from the thread, all beings find their existence in the Supreme Lord. This understanding encourages devotees to recognize their relationship with Krishna and the importance of surrendering to Him for spiritual advancement. By acknowledging Krishna as the source of all truth, individuals can cultivate a deeper devotion and align their lives with divine purpose."

    "purport": "In this verse, the Lord explains the relationship between His divine energy and the material nature. He emphasizes that material nature operates under His direction. The phrase 'prākṛtyā 'vimokṣyati' indicates that those who understand this truth can transcend the influence of material nature and attain liberation. The wise, referred to as 'buddhāḥ,' recognize the Supreme Lord as the ultimate controller of all energies and thus engage in devotional service. This understanding leads to a deeper appreciation of the Lord's position and fosters a sincere desire to serve Him. Ultimately, this verse encourages individuals to see beyond the material world and recognize the divine hand guiding all creation."

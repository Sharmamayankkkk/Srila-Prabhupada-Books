    "translation": "Indeed, true happiness cannot be achieved through the changes of the body. The far-seeing person who remains unaffected by desires and actions, is the one who attains supreme bliss, unaffected by worldly distractions.",
    "purport": "In this verse, Lord Krishna is emphasizing that lasting happiness cannot come from physical changes or worldly possessions. Happiness derived from material experiences is fleeting and superficial. The true yogi, who is unattached to the desires of the senses, remains unaffected by changes in the body or material conditions. Such a yogi’s joy comes from within, through the cultivation of spiritual knowledge and self-realization. The verse highlights the importance of inner peace, which arises only when one has transcended egoistic desires and external pursuits. Real bliss comes from connecting with the divine and the soul, rather than through transient material achievements."

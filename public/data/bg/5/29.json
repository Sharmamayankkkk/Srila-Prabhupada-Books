    "translation": "One who knows Me as the ultimate enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, as the Supreme Lord of all worlds, and as the friend of all living beings, attains peace.",
    "purport": "In this verse, Lord Krishna explains the nature of true peace. Real peace is attained by understanding the Divine as the ultimate source and enjoyer of all actions. When a person recognizes Krishna as the Supreme Lord, the ultimate cause of all sacrifice, and the friend of all living beings, they transcend the material limitations of the body and mind. This knowledge leads to liberation from the cycle of desires and the disturbances of the material world. The peace that Krishna speaks of here is a state of harmony, where one realizes that all actions are offerings to the Divine, and one’s true nature is in union with the Supreme. By knowing Krishna in this way, the individual experiences a profound sense of tranquility, free from the fluctuations of worldly attachments and ego."

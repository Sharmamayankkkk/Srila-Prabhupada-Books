    "translation": "When they have thus enjoyed vast heavenly pleasures, they return to the mortal world when their merit is exhausted. Thus, those who follow the Vedic rituals, desiring sense enjoyment, take repeated birth and death.",
    "purport": "One who is promoted to higher planetary systems enjoys a longer life and better sensual facilities, but they cannot remain there indefinitely. Once their accumulated piety is exhausted, they return to the earthly realm. Those who do not attain true knowledge of the Absolute Truth—Kṛṣṇa—are caught in the endless cycle of promotion and demotion, similar to a ferris wheel. They rise to heaven and fall again to earth. Such movement between higher and lower realms is ultimately unproductive for spiritual advancement. Instead, one should seek entry into the spiritual world, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, free from the miseries of birth and death."

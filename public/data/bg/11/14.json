    "translation": "Then Arjuna, overwhelmed with wonder and with his hair standing on end, bowed his head to the Supreme Lord and with folded hands began to speak.",
    "purport": "After witnessing the universal form, Arjuna's perception of Kṛṣṇa is transformed. Formerly seeing Him as a friend and charioteer, Arjuna is now struck with awe. This reverence is expressed through his physical response—his hair stands on end in ecstasy—and by offering full obeisances with folded hands. This verse marks a turning point in their relationship. Arjuna no longer addresses Kṛṣṇa casually but with divine reverence. It illustrates the transition from sakhya-rasa (friendly relationship) to adbhuta-rasa (the mood of wonder). Though not afraid, Arjuna is overcome with awe, acknowledging the majesty and divinity of the Lord he once considered simply his companion."

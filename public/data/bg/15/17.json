    "translation": "Besides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Lord Himself, who has entered into these worlds and is maintaining them.",
    "purport": "This verse is beautifully expressed in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad and Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad. It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities—some of whom are conditioned and some liberated—there is the Supreme Personality, known as Paramātmā. The Upaniṣadic verse runs as follows: 'nityo nityānāṁ, cetanaś cetanānām.' The meaning is that among all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and provides all the facilities for enjoyment according to their respective actions. This Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart as Paramātmā. A wise person who can understand Him is eligible to attain perfect peace, while others are not. It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects. There is always a distinction of superiority and inferiority in their personalities. The word 'uttama' is particularly significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 'Loke' is also significant, as in the Pauruṣa (a Vedic text) it is stated: 'lokyate vedārtho'nena.' This Supreme Lord, in His localized aspect as Paramātmā, explains the purpose of the Vedas. The following verse also appears in the Vedas: tāvad eṣa samprasādo 'smāc charīrāt samutthāya paraṁ jyoti-rūpaṁ sampadya svena rūpeṇābhiniṣpadyate sa uttamaḥ puruṣaḥ \"The Supersoul, coming out of the body, enters the impersonal brahmajyoti. Then, in His form, He remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme is called the Supreme Personality.\" This means that the Supreme Personality exhibits and diffuses His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That Supreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Paramātmā. By incarnating as the son of Satyavatī and Parāśara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as Vyāsadeva."

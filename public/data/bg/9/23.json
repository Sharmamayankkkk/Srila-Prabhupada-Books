    "translation": "Even those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship Me alone, O son of Kuntī, but they do so in a wrong way.",
    "purport": "Kṛṣṇa clarifies that worship of demigods, though done with faith, is not the recommended or fully understood method. Demigods are like administrative officers working under the Supreme Lord’s direction. Worship directed to them is like trying to please a company manager instead of honoring the owner. Kṛṣṇa is the root of all existence. Just as watering the root nourishes the whole tree, worshiping Kṛṣṇa satisfies all demigods. Worshiping demigods separately is considered *avidhi-pūrvakam*—improper or indirect—and does not lead to the highest realization. Therefore, intelligent persons worship Kṛṣṇa directly, understanding Him as the ultimate beneficiary of all offerings and devotion."

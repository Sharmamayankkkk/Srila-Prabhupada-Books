    "translation": "Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly. They take birth on the planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights.",
    "purport": "The word *trai-vidyāḥ* refers to the three Vedas — Sāma, Yajur and Ṛg. A brāhmaṇa who has studied these three Vedas is called a *tri-vedī*. Anyone who is very much attached to knowledge derived from these Vedas is respected in society. Unfortunately, many great scholars of the Vedas do not know the ultimate purpose of studying them. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa herein declares Himself to be the final goal of the *tri-vedīs*. Actual *tri-vedīs* take shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and engage in pure devotional service. Devotional service begins with chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra and trying to understand Kṛṣṇa in truth. Those who are simply formal students of the Vedas often worship demigods like Indra or Candra for material elevation. By performing such sacrifices, they become purified and reach higher planetary systems like Maharloka, Janaloka, and Tapoloka, where sense enjoyment is many times greater than on earth."

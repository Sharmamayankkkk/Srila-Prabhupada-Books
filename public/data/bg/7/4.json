This emphasizes the intimate connection between the Supreme Lord and all beings. Krishna identifies Himself as the beginning, middle, and end of all creation, indicating that everything emanates from Him, exists within Him, and ultimately returns to Him. This understanding fosters a sense of unity and interconnectedness among all living beings, highlighting the divine presence in every aspect of life. Recognizing Krishna as the Supreme Self encourages devotees to cultivate a deeper relationship with Him, leading to spiritual growth and liberation from material bondage."

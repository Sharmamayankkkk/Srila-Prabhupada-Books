    "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: My dear friend, mighty-armed Arjuna, listen again to My supreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit and which will give you great joy.",
    "purport": "The word paramam is explained thus by Parāśara Muni: one who is full in  six  opulences,  who  has  full  strength,  full  fame,  wealth,  knowledge, beauty  and  renunciation,  is  paramam,  or  the  Supreme  Personality  of Godhead.  While  Kṛṣṇa  was  present  on  this  earth,  He  displayed  all  six opulences. Therefore great sages like Parāśara Muni have all accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now Kṛṣṇa is instructing Arjuna in more  confidential  knowledge  of  His  opulences  and  His  work.  Previously, beginning  with  the  Seventh  Chapter,  the  Lord  already  explained  His different energies and how they are acting. Now in this chapter He explains His  specific  opulences  to  Arjuna.  In  the  previous  chapter  he  has  clearly explained  His  different  energies  to  establish  devotion  in  firm  conviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences.\nThe more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in  devotional  service.  One  should  always  hear  about  the  Lord  in  the association  of  devotees;  that  will  enhance  one's  devotional  service. Discourses in the society of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses. The Lord clearly tells Arjuna that because he is very dear to Him, for his benefit such discourses are taking place."
